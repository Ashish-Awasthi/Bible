<p class="page_81a"><span class="american_typewriter">Joseph is introduced in Genesis 37, and in chapter 41 at<br/>the age of thirty becomes the Pharaoh&#8217;s prime minister.<br/>The brothers first seek food in Egypt in Genesis 42.</span></p>
<p class="page_81aa"><span class="american_typewriter">The Pharaoh sends wagons to bring Joesph&#8217;s family<br/>down to Egypt in Genesis 45. Jacob&#8217;s emotional reunion<br/>with Joseph occurs in Genesis 46. Genesis ends with the<br/>burials of Jacob in Canaan and of Joseph in Egypt.</span></p>
<p class="page_81aaa"><span class="american_typewriter">The Book of Exodus opens when the generations that<br/>followed Joseph and his brothers have multiplied.<br/>Fearing that the growing minority could turn against<br/>them, the Egyptians turn the Hebrews into slaves.</span></p>
<p class="page_81aaaa"><span class="american_typewriter">Moses is born into the house of Levi, put in the basket,<br/>and found by Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter in Exodus 2. The<br/>second half of this chapter shows him grown up and no<br/>longer able to live like a privileged Egyptian.</span></p>
<p class="page_81aaaaa"><span class="american_typewriter">The Lord reveals Himself through the burning bush on<br/>Mount Horeb in chapter 3, but Moses refuses to go back<br/>to Egypt until the next chapter. It was not always easy<br/>for prophets to accept the missions God gave them.</span></p>
<p class="page_81aaaaaa"><span class="american_typewriter">The plagues begin in Exodus 7 and end with the Passover<br/>in chapter 12. God spares Goshen, where the Hebrews<br/>live, so that the torrents of pests, fire, hail, darkness,<br/>and death do not come to them.</span></p>
<p class="page_81aaaaaaa"><span class="space01"><span class="american_typewriter">Exodus 14 tells how Pharoah changed his mind about</span></span><br/><span class="american_typewriter">letting the people go and sent his army after the people<br/>of Israel. Miriam&#8217;s song of triumph (chapter 15) is one of<br/>the Bible&#8217;s oldest poems. Manna, quails, and the greatest<br/>miracle in ancient plumbing follow in 16 and 17.</span></p>
<p class="page_81aaaaaaaa"><span class="space01"><span class="american_typewriter">The Ten Commandments are dictated in Exodus 20 and</span></span><br/><span class="american_typewriter">repeated with minor variations in Deuteronomy 5.</span></p>
<p class="page_81aaaaaaaaa"><span class="american_typewriter">Exodus 32 records how Moses&#8217; brother Aaron melted<br/>the people&#8217;s gold earrings and turned them into an idol.<br/>In fury, Moses then breaks the tablets, burns the calf,<br/>and orders the people to consume the ashes.</span></p>
