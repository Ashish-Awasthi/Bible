<p class="page_79aa"><span class="space01"><span class="american_typewriter">The Bible was first written in Hebrew and Aramaic and then translated into</span></span><br/><span style="margin-left:-20px"><span class="american_typewriter">Greek and Latin. Many of the original words, phrases and stories have confused<br/>scholars for centuries. Because modern English is so different from ancient</span></span><br/><span class="space01"><span style="margin-left:34px"><span class="american_typewriter">Hebrew, there are a variety of ways to express what the Bible says.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="page_79aaa"><span class="space01"><span class="american_typewriter">English Bibles can be found on the internet by including their titles and &#8220;online</span></span><br/><span style="margin-left:03px"><span class="american_typewriter">Bible&#8221; in your search terms. <a href="http://Biblos.com">Biblos.com</a> offers a comprehensive selection that</span></span><br/><span style="margin-left:-02px"><span class="space01"><span class="american_typewriter">includes an interlinear tool that allows you to see the translation word by word.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="page_79aaaa"><span class="space01"><span class="american_typewriter">Here are some examples of the best-known publications.</span></span></p>
<p class="page_79aaaaa"><span class="american_typewriter">Jewish Publication Society</span></p>
<p class="page_79aaaaaa"><span class="space1"><span class="american_typewriter">The JPS 1917 version can be found at <a href="http://breslov.com">breslov.com</a> and is</span></span><br/><span class="space2"><span style="margin-left:20px"><span class="american_typewriter">sensitive to the orthodox respect for the divine name.</span></span></span><br/><span class="space2"><span style="margin-left:-10px"><span class="american_typewriter">The more recent edition is called the Tanakh, a short way</span></span></span><br/><span class="space2"><span style="margin-left:28px"><span class="american_typewriter">of stating its contents: Torah, Prophets and Writings.</span></p>
<p class="page_79aaaaaaa"><span class="american_typewriter">King James Version</span></p>
<p class="page_79aaaaaaaa"><span class="space01"><span class="american_typewriter">This was the third official English translation, authorized by James II for the<br/>Church of England in 1611. As a Christian Bible, it includes the New Testament.<br/>Although people from many denominations admire its elegant phrasings, the<br/>old-fashioned style can prove a challenge to understand.</span></span></p>
<p class="page_79aaaaaaaaa"><span class="american_typewriter">Douay-Rheims</span></p>
<p class="page_79aaaaaaaaaa"><span class="space01"><span class="american_typewriter">Catholics also produced an English Bible, which they translated from Saint</span></span><br/><span class="american_typewriter"><span class="space01">Jerome&#8217;s Latin version of the Bible called the Vulgate.</span> This means the English is<br/><span class="space01">two steps away from the original Hebrew. It is less</span> commonly read today but still<br/><span class="space01">the preferred version of Scripture by traditional</span> Catholics.</span></p>
<p class="page_79aaaaaaaaaaa"><span class="american_typewriter">Revised Standard Version</span></p>
<p class="page_79aaaaaaaaaaaa"><span class="space01"><span class="american_typewriter">First published in the decade after World War II, the RSV aimed to provide more<br/>accurate ways of expressing Old Testament Hebrew. It is similar to the<br/>Jerusalem Bible and other modern editions for sounding more like the language</span></span><br/><span class="american_typewriter"><span class="space01">we speak today. A &#8220;New&#8221; RSV adapts</span> phrases like &#8220;sons of Israel&#8221; to &#8220;children of<br/><span class="space01">Israel&#8221; so that all readers feel</span> included.</span></p>
<p class="page_79aaaaaaaaaaaaa"><span class="american_typewriter">Good News Bible</span></p>
<p class="page_79aaaaaaaaaaaaaa"><span class="space01"><span class="american_typewriter">Also known as the Good News Translation,<br/>this conveys the Hebrew &#8220;thought for<br/>thought&#8221; rather than &#8220;word for word&#8221;. Some<br/>find that original meanings can get lost in this<br/><span class="space1">process, but its simple</span> style is easy to read.</span></span></p>
